I had the pleasure of collaborating with @JohnRoesler on the go-co-op/gocron project, and I can confidently say that he is an exceptional contributor. 
Johnâ€™s dedication to open-source projects and his ability to encourage and guide others truly stands out. He fostered a welcoming environment for contributors, and motivated me to actively participate and improve my skills.
